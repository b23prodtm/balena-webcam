  A security webcam application is a video surveillance system. At the foundation of this app is the [Kerberos.io Agent](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent), which is a cutting edge modular video surveillance system, made available as Open Source under the MIT License, with a strong focus on user experience, scalability, resilience, extension and integration. The idea of this app is to include more blocks over-time to improve and include new functionalities.

  # At the core: Kerberos Agent

  Kerberos.io applies the concept of agents. An agent is running next to or on your camera, and is processing a single camera feed. It applies motion based recording and make those recordings available through a user friendly web interface. Kerberos Agent allows you to connect to other cloud services or custom applications. Kerberos Agent is perfect for personal usage and/or is a great tool if you only have a couple of surveillance cameras to be processed.

  If you are looking for a solution that scales better with your video surveillance and/or video analytics requirements, [Kerberos Enterprise Suite might be a better fit](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise/first-things-first).

  ## The most important features

  - Low memory and CPU usage.

  - Simplified and modern user interface.

  - Multi architecture (ARMv7, ARMv8, amd64, etc).

  - Multi camera support: IP Cameras (H264), USB cameras and Raspberry Pi Cameras [through a RTSP proxy](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp).

  - Single camera per instance (e.g. one container per camera).

  - Cloud storage/persistance: Kerberos Hub, Kerberos Vault and Dropbox.

  - REST API access and documentation through Swagger (trigger recording, update configuration, etc).

  - MIT License
